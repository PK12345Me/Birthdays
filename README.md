# Birthdays
Flask web application using Jinja as templating language and a SQLite database for storing birthdays

It also contains - birthdays.db which is a SQLite database with one table, birthdays, that has four columns: id, name, month, and day. This web application will support the ability to insert rows into this table!

In the static directory there should be a styles.css file containing the CSS code for this web application. No need to edit this file, though you’re welcome to if you’d like!

In the templates directory is an index.html file that will be rendered when the user views your web application.
